# CSharpNet-Web-System

Raising issues:

Problems identified across the contributors of this project will be raised in "Issues" section.
The convention of the title should be the following - "CSWS-100-Brief Task description".
Attachments can help (images/videos) if the bug seems to be harder to reproduce.

Commit messages:

The message should start with prefix which depends of the task type - doc, style, refactor, chore, feat, fix.
It should be followed with description of the impl. done in the scope of the commit.
At the end of it will be a good practice to have the task number i.e CSWS-100 or the default one CSWS-999.
An example for commit message - "feat: Create base dialog class in web project - CSWS-145"

Raising pull requests:

Start your branch from "develop" as base one.
Source branch should follow this convention -> style/CSWS-945-change-home-title-apearance (will be dependent on the task labels)
Prepare your implementation and test.
Push your branch and make pull request -> add description if possible (comment).
Target branch should always be "develop" not "main"
